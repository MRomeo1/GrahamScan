# GrahamScan #
Graham scan programming project for computational geometry

### Overview ###
Graham Scan is an O(n log n) algorithm for computing convex hulls.

### Implementation Details ###
This implementation of the Graham Scan algorithm uses Python to compute the comvex hull and MatPlotLib to display the results and allow the user to interact with the plot.

### Usage ###
